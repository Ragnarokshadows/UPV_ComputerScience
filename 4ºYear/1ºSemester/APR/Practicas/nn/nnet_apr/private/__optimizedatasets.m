## @code{__optimizedatasets} reranges the data sets depending on the input arguments.
## @code{matrix} is the data set matrix containing inputs and outputs (targets) in row order.
## This means for example: the first three rows are inputs and the fourth row is an output row.
## The second argument is used in the optimizing algorithm. All cols with min and max values must
## be in the range of the train data sets. The third argument defines how much rows are equal to the
## neural network targets. These rows must be at the end of the data set!
## The fourth arguemnt is optional and defines if the data sets have to be randomised before
## optimizing.
## Default value for bRand is 1, means randomise the columns.
